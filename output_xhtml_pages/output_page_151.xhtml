<p>123</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p>
<p>Defend — through </p>
<p>life’s ups and </p>
<p>downs</p><p>At Sufficient Funds, we call ourselves optimistic realists. Why? Well, </p>
<p>the funny thing about having a plan and life goals is that life can at </p>
<p>times be completely unpredictable and totally unplannable. As the </p>
<p>American TV writer and producer Barbara Hall once put it, ‘The </p>
<p>path to our destination is not always a straight one. We go down </p>
<p>the wrong road, we get lost, we turn back. Maybe it doesn’t matter </p>
<p>which road we embark on. Maybe what matters is that we embark.’</p><p>Despite our best intentions, life has a way of throwing spanners in </p>
<p>the works at the most inconvenient moments. We want you to keep </p>
<p>this reality in mind as you build out your life and money plans: shit </p>
<p>happens, but it’ll be okay.</p><p>Not only will you have set up your insanely helpful spending plan </p>
<p>(chapter  2) and mapped out where to invest any excess funds </p>
