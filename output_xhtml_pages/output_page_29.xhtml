<p>1</p><p>Define — the </p>
<p>missing step</p><p>Define is your starting point on the road to Sufficient Funds. This </p>
<p>is where you define, to the best of your ability right now, what a </p>
<p>fulfilling and successful life looks like to you. As Nelson Mandela </p>
<p>famously said, ‘There is no passion to be found in settling for a life </p>
<p>that is less than the one you are capable of living.’</p><p>My life’s work has been bundled into the work we do every day in our </p>
<p>aptly named business, Sufficient Funds. At its core, it’s a financial </p>
<p>planning and mortgage broking business. But, as you might have </p>
<p>guessed, we spin things a little differently over here, and this is </p>
<p>providing phenomenal results for the peeps we’re working with.</p><p>One point of difference is our acceptance, as money nerds, that </p>
<p>it’s not all about money. In fact, when we first meet people, we put </p>
<p>money aside completely and focus solely on ‘Defining Sufficient’. </p>
<p>This is motivating, fun and challenging. We focus on your life goals </p>
<p>and values, so it forms the foundation for all your future money </p>
<p>plans and decisions.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
