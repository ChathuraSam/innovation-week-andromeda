<p>Insufficient Funds</p><p>190</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Investing serious time and money in business opportunities </p>
<p>or charitable pursuits</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Fully kitting out a LandCruiser and camper-trailer for </p>
<p>regular family adventures</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Designing and custom building your own home on five </p>
<p>acres overlooking the beach or rolling hills</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Funding medical research in an area you’ve personally </p>
<p>had to access so others never have to suffer what you </p>
<p>went through</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Venturing into space</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Investing in your own health and wellbeing so you’ll benefit </p>
<p>from what you have achieved.</p><p>Remember, achieving Sufficient is not a goal to apply only to money. </p>
<p>I want you to create abundant wealth, yes, but the vision I have for </p>
<p>you includes the time and the health to enjoy it. Imagine a world in </p>
<p>which money isn’t a constraint on your time, and your time isn’t a </p>
<p>constraint to your health.</p><p>Now imagine the new feeling you’d have if this was your reality </p>
<p>and how far that feeling is from that dismal message of ‘Insufficient </p>
<p>Funds’ on the ATM slip. Let go of that image, hold onto that new </p>
<p>feeling and go smash it!</p>
