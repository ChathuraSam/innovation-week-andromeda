<p>Insufficient Funds</p><p>xvi</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Yosemite, CA — hiking and teaming up with a couple of </p>
<p>locals who cooked us our first barbecued steaks in months </p>
<p>(shout-out to Kevin and Sheldon, who then poured all the </p>
<p>leftover blood and meat juices around our tent in the hope </p>
<p>we’d experience the local grizzlies up close and personal)</p><p>•	</p>
<p>all the natural wonders — from General Sherman in Sequoia </p>
<p>National Park, one of the tallest trees in the world, to Grand </p>
<p>Canyon and Sedona in Arizona</p><p>•	</p>
<p>surfing famed California breaks like Steamer Lane and </p>
<p>Trestles, and many lesser-known remote spots in Oregon, </p>
<p>Cali and Baja, Mexico</p><p>•	</p>
<p>renting kayaks (and scoring bonus joints) from a guy in La </p>
<p>Bufadora on the Baja coast, and spending the next five hours </p>
<p>exploring the blowhole and random caves — Sammy losing </p>
<p>his sunnies and thongs while trying to ride the ‘rapids’</p><p>•	</p>
<p>driving through Death Valley, CA, with no aircon, where a </p>
<p>flat tyre meant the boys changing the flat in 52-degree heat </p>
<p>while I was busy fertilising the cacti as a result of severe </p>
<p>food poisoning (thanks Mexico!)</p><p>•	</p>
<p>turning 21 in Vegas — enough said</p><p>•	</p>
<p>partying with a 60-year-old pimp named Al Jolly in  </p>
<p>Dallas, TX</p><p>•	</p>
<p>riding bikes, dodging snakes and massive gators, around the </p>
