<p>Insufficient Funds</p><p>140</p><p>I’ve found, both personally and working with many clients, that </p>
<p>while babies might reduce our income for a time, they don’t usually </p>
<p>increase our expenses very much while they’re little. Less clubbing </p>
<p>and fancy dinners, more nappies and triple-­</p>
<p>shot flatties — they tend </p>
<p>to balance out.</p><p>Back to work</p><p>Full-­</p>
<p>time, part-­</p>
<p>time, new business or never again? One of the key </p>
<p>advantages of achieving Sufficient Funds is doing work you enjoy, </p>
<p>so I hope it’s not the latter. But for now, let’s go with whatever floats </p>
<p>your boat.</p><p>When you’re mapping this out in advance and tossing up between </p>
<p>three or four days as an example, plan for three days of income so if </p>
<p>you do the extra day, it’s a bonus and not a necessity.</p><p>My experience is that even the most career-­</p>
<p>oriented new parents </p>
<p>are likely to have a fresh view on work post baby.</p><p>Figure 4.1: parental leave budget</p>
