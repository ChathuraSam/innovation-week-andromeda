<p>Introduction</p><p>xxiii</p><p>Experience has shown me that there are five important steps on the </p>
<p>road from Insufficient to Sufficient Funds. These are:</p><p>1.	 Define</p><p>2.	 Declutter</p><p>3.	 Develop</p><p>4.	 Defend</p><p>5.	 Deliver.</p><p>To be very clear, I have found that only once you’ve nailed each of these </p>
<p>five steps can you expect to achieve your goals, so I’ve structured the </p>
<p>book accordingly and I strongly recommend that you read and action </p>
<p>these stages in the order in which they are introduced.</p><p>In chapter 1: Define, I’ll discuss the importance of mindset, and </p>
<p>help you map out your particular definition of Sufficient Funds.</p><p>In chapter 2: Declutter, you’ll learn how to set up a fail-safe system </p>
<p>to remove money waste from your life, so every day you can smash </p>
<p>out money moves like you’ve never done before.</p><p>Chapter 3: Develop is where the rubber really hits the road — think </p>
<p>investments, tax and superannuation — but in a way that’s easy to </p>
<p>digest. This is where you move on from simply counting your chips </p>
<p>to strategically building ‘mad stacks’ that link directly to the goals </p>
<p>and values you defined in chapter 1.</p>
