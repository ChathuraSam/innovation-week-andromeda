<p>187</p><p>THINK BIGGER: </p>
<p>BEYOND </p>
<p>SUFFICIENT</p><p>At the beginning of this book I described the helpless feeling </p>
<p>associated with Insufficient Funds and how I wanted to transport </p>
<p>you as far from that feeling as possible. I mentioned that if you </p>
<p>remain in a position of Insufficient Funds for too long, you are likely </p>
<p>to have to settle for a less enjoyable life and, ultimately, for being </p>
<p>unhappy and completely unfulfilled.</p><p>Throughout this book you’ve been working on defining and setting </p>
<p>the wheels in motion on your version of Sufficient. In five chapters </p>
<p>we’ve outlined a clear plan for exactly how you will Define, Declutter, </p>
<p>Develop, Defend and Deliver in order to reach Sufficient Funds. </p>
<p>Now you can be clear and confident about your future, you have </p>
<p>a protection plan and suitable buffers in place and you’re building </p>
<p>mad stacks in all the areas you need so you can achieve all the big </p>
<p>goals you’ve set for yourself. Life is good!</p>
