<p>Defend — through life’s ups and downs</p><p>131</p><p>If endo or other chronic illness is a factor for you and you want </p>
<p>relatable financial advice to help wade through funding options and </p>
<p>still living your life to the fullest, reach out.</p><p>What will you be dealing with, and how much will it cost?  As with </p>
<p>any stage in your life, once you decide to have a family (refer back </p>
<p>to chapter  2), you’ll need to plan. Depending on your income </p>
<p>and budget, think about whether you’ll save for this in an extra </p>
<p>‘squirrel account: baby fund’, or whether you can ‘cash flow it’ </p>
<p>with your ongoing income from parental leave (from work and/</p>
<p>or the government’s Parental Leave Pay) or sufficient income </p>
<p>from a spouse or partner. I’ve outlined some of the potential </p>
<p>costs below.</p><p>It may be easy to chunk this planning into the following stages to </p>
<p>help both financially and emotionally, as you think it through:</p><p>•	</p>
<p>trying to conceive</p><p>•	</p>
<p>pregnancy</p><p>•	</p>
<p>birth and setup</p><p>•	</p>
<p>time off / parental leave</p><p>•	</p>
<p>back to work</p><p>•	</p>
<p>child care</p><p>•	</p>
<p>schooling.</p>
