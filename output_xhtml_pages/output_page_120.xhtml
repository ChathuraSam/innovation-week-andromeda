<p>Insufficient Funds</p><p>92</p><p>Benefits of micro-­</p>
<p>investing include:</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Ease of use . First and foremost, these apps are easy to </p>
<p>get started with a simple download and registration, and </p>
<p>they remain easy to use for regular, hassle-­</p>
<p>free investing, </p>
<p>accessible on your phone. For most of us who are time-­</p>
<p>poor, </p>
<p>the ability to take a quick squiz and toggle through your </p>
<p>investments while sitting on the train, whiling away time in </p>
<p>a waiting room or waiting for kids’ sport to finally wrap up, </p>
<p>this is a smart choice.</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Low barrier to entry . Most apps allow users to start </p>
<p>investing with very small amounts of money, making it </p>
<p>super simple to build up a diversified portfolio over time. </p>
<p>Some apps even allow ‘round-­</p>
<p>ups’, where you can round </p>
<p>your everyday purchases up and use your spare change to </p>
<p>invest. Some have kids’ investing options, which can make </p>
<p>the concept of investing on behalf of your kids an easy win. </p>
<p>Parent-­</p>
<p>managed kids’ portfolios are also a great way to </p>
<p>introduce young children to the concept of investing (more </p>
<p>than we ever learned in school!).</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Set and forget . Many micro-­</p>
<p>investing apps allow you to set </p>
<p>up effortless, automatic deposits directly from your savings. </p>
<p>Automation, similar to what I discussed around your </p>
<p>savings, can save on brainpower, especially if your mental </p>
<p>load is already stacked against you, or if you’re tempted to </p>
<p>use your loose change somewhere else.</p>
