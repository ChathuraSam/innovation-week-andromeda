<p>Insufficient Funds</p><p>78</p><p>•	</p>
<p>Super : After successfully utilising the FHSS for part of her </p>
<p>home deposit, being on track to pay out the mortgage and </p>
<p>be financially flexible in her early 50s, she now has a clear </p>
<p>runway to starting to really pump her super fund.</p><p>To summarise the four stacks of Sufficient Funds philosophy: </p>
<p>you will generally have a few stacks that you’re piling into </p>
<p>simultaneously, all driven by their ROI, your main goals and their </p>
<p>desired timeframes.</p><p>From the top, once Debt is taken care of (that is, you have no bad </p>
<p>debt, and remaining debt, such as mortgage, investment, education </p>
<p>and car loan, is on track for the desired timeframe), focus on </p>
<p>Savings. Once your cash needs are on track to be sufficiently </p>
<p>stacked, then you can think about pumping Investment. Investment </p>
<p>and Super can be pumped simultaneously. If your investment stacks </p>
<p> </p>
<p>are on track to handle all your pre-­</p>
<p>retirement goals — for </p>
<p>example, working part-­</p>
<p>time, kids’ schooling, beach house — then </p><p>Note:  For calculating passive income (in this case, income </p>
<p>derived from investments that you don’t have to work for, or even </p>
<p>better, that allow you to stop working!), use a 5 per cent return </p>
<p>and, if invested well, you shouldn’t need to eat into your capital </p>
<p>(your investment balance remains intact): $1 </p>
<p>000 </p>
<p>000 generates </p>
<p>$50 </p>
<p>000 p.a. income forever. In your head, simply remove a zero </p>
<p>and divide by 2:</p><p>$1 </p>
<p>000 </p>
<p>000  →  (remove zero)  →  $100 </p>
<p>000  →  (divide x 2)  </p>
<p>→  $50 </p>
