<p>template, set up your account structure and renamed your </p>
<p>accounts online.</p><p>■</p>
<p>■</p>
<p>You’ve set up automation on your accounts so your money </p>
<p>flows exactly as intended, without getting in your own way </p>
<p>and messing it up.</p><p>Hell yeah! You did it! Extra congrats if this is totally not your </p>
<p>everyday jam. We see all types in the clients we work with and </p>
<p>I know you’re either loving this or somehow forcing yourself </p>
<p>through it anyway. Either way you’re not alone and I’m bloody </p>
<p>proud of the fact that you’re now taking charge and controlling </p>
<p>your future.</p><p>Don’t forget the final step of celebrating your new decluttered </p>
<p>money status </p>

<p>you’ve earned it!</p><p>You’re clear and focused and  fully understand your cash in </p>
<p>and cash out. This lines you up perfectly for developing your </p>
<p>growth strategy!</p><p>Now it’s time to answer the question that will help you dial this up </p>
<p>big time:  Where does what you have left over go?</p><p>66</p>
