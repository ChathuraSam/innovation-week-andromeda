<p>but this has become a watch-­</p>
<p>out for a lot of people. It’s easy </p>
<p>to fall into the trap of collecting these ever-­</p>
<p>multiplying services </p>
<p>(for example Binge, Kayo, Netflix, Disney+, Stan, Apple TV). I’ve </p>
<p>seen clients spending over $250 per month on these, where </p>
<p>they thought it was only $50. Again, I’m not here to tell you what </p>
<p>to spend on, but check yourself if it’s getting a little wild, and </p>
<p>drop the ones you’re not using right now. You can pick them up </p>
<p>later if needed; that’s the beauty of ‘no contracts’!</p><p>Accounts</p><p>The account structure aligns with the categories above, with a few </p>
<p>extra splits for specific and common goals.</p><p>I meet people all the time who tell me one of many versions of this: </p>
<p>‘James, I feel like I earn way too much to have this little.’ Figure 2.2 </p>
<p>(overleaf) introduces a couple of case studies (names removed to </p>
<p>protect the innocent!).</p>
