<p>Insufficient Funds</p><p>50</p><p>We follow a very simple split of categories. Either it’s fun or it’s </p>
<p>boring. You have living costs (boring) and lifestyle costs (fun). </p>
<p>Another way to think about this is that living costs are not really </p>
<p>discretionary; that is, you can’t really live without them, or at least </p>
<p>you’ve made the decision that they’re essential in your life. Lifestyle </p>
<p>costs are based on discretionary choices made based on what makes </p>
<p>you happy, but in an emergency you could drop or cut back on most </p>
<p>of these if needed.</p><p>Here are a few common examples:</p><p>•	</p>

<p>as seriously as children, so for most these are not just </p>
<p>lifestyle decisions)</p><p>–</p>
